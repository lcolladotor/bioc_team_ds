# Building Tidy Tools

In order to organize our code, test it, and share it internally and also externally, we write R packages. Some of them we submit them to Bioconductor and share them more widely. There are several R packages that make the process of writing new R packages easier, such as `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("devtools")`, `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("usethis")`, `r BiocStyle::CRANpkg("roxygen2")`, and `r BiocStyle::Githubpkg("lcolladotor/biocthis")`. To learn more about `devtools` and friends, we revised the material from the `rstudio::conf(2020)` workshop [**Building Tidy Tools**](https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2020/build-tidy-tools) that was taught by [Charlotte Wickham](https://bsky.app/profile/cwick.co.nz) and [Hadley Wickham](https://bsky.app/profile/hadleywickham.bsky.social). In the LIBD rstats club, we've also used materials from their 2019 workshop.

The _Building Tidy Tools_ workshop is very useful if you want to transition from R user to R developer. If you are a Spanish speaker, you might be interested in our translation of their `rstudio::conf(2019)` workshop at [CDBS](https://github.com/ComunidadBioInfo/cdsb2019).

## Bootcamp sessions

This workshop involves several exercises, which we highly recommend that you try to solve. One of our solutions is [`lahuuki/foofactors2`](https://github.com/lahuuki/foofactors2). Below you can watch the videos of our training sessions.
