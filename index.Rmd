# Overview {-}

Welcome to the [**R/Bioconductor-powered Team Data Science**](http://lcolladotor.github.io) documentation website/book! The purpose of this website is to serve as a guide for training new team members and colleagues on how we do R/Bioconductor-powered Team Data Science. This documentation book contains more details for on boarding, how to ask for help, bootcamps, writing papers, authorship, configuration files, and much more.

As a team, we run [Data Science guidance sessions](#data-science-guidance-sessions) where we help others navigate the world of data science. Through those sessions we identify concepts that we might need to explain better and this book is where we concentrate all our knowledge. Thus it is continuously modified and expanded. We often refer others to this specific chapters of this book, which in a way is a gloried collection of bookmarks with some of our own explanations.

Here is a **TLDR** (_too long did not read_) 2025 version of what the team has expertise in analyzing ([slides orchestrated by Louise Huuki-Myers](https://speakerdeck.com/lahuuki/2025-libd-data-science-team-tl-dr)).

## Code of conduct {-}

We follow the LIBD conduct policies as well the [Bioconductor code of conduct](http://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/). The [LIBD rstats club code of conduct](http://research.libd.org/rstatsclub/#coc) is currently outdated and will be updated based on the Bioconductor code of conduct.
