["introduction.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction The purpose of this book is to serve as a guide for training new team members and colleagues on how we do R/Bioconductor-powered Team Data Science. As a team, we run Data Science guidance sessions where we help others navigate the world of data science. Through those sessions we identify concepts that we might need to explain better and this book is where we concentrate all our knowledge. Thus it is continuously modified and expanded. We often refer others to this specific chapters of this book, which in a way is a gloried collection of bookmarks with some of our own explanations. "],

Most of the material these bootcamps are based on is freely available or can be purchased for a small fee. Thus, we can feel confident that our LIBD and JHU collaborators will be able to access the material, as well as really anyone else in the world. 3.1 Team bootcamps The first iteration of these bootcamps were run on September 2020 with the following schedule. For all of them, you should have the latest R and RStudio versions installed in your computer and be familiar with the R programming language. You will probably need to spend time self-learning and practicing some of the material beyond these videos.

Just like git commit messages, channels are cheap. The idea is to make one channel per project. Currently, we are adding all team members to each channel even if they are not working on the specific project. Team members not involved in the project should feel free to mute the channel. However, by being a part of the channel, they can then see images and code that we are working on, which in some situations can be useful. For example, maybe we figured out how to make a new plotly interactive graph in one channel, then others who are curious can get access to that knowledge and incorporate it into their projects.

["team-meetings.html", "6 Team meetings 6.1 Papers &amp; software 6.2 DSgs: feedback 6.3 Team help", " 6 Team meetings Every week we meet for about an hour 20 minutes. The team meeting has three sections: [30 min] Papers &amp; software: we discuss either a paper or some software. The discussion is lead by a team member and the presentation is made public while the discussion is kept private. [30 min] Data Science guidance sessions: we talk about our sessions and provide internal feedback. [20 min] Help requests: we give open the floor to discuss anything we need help on from the rest of the team. 6.1 Papers &amp; software Each week, we rotate team members randomly using jaffelab::lab_presenters() as shown on this Google Spreadsheet. That team member is in charge of: finding a paper or a software of interest notifying the group about it one week ahead on Slack preparing a few slides to explain the main concepts to us (plan for a 15 minute presentation) We record that portion of our meeting and make it publicly available through TODO. We then discuss privately our thoughts on the paper or software. 6.1.1 Notes If you are randomly assigned a date that does not work for you, please get in touch with other team members and find someone who can switch with you. Thank you! If you are interested in joining us, please check our code of conduct, and get in touch with Leonardo. 6.2 DSgs: feedback Every week, the DSgs-guides meet to discuss recent guidance sessions with the following objectives: identify common topics that can be addressed in other venues such as the LIBD rstats club, this book, blog posts, etc ensure consistency of our responses to similar questions identify and address issues with our DSgs interaction rules We might identify topics that we need to either train the DSgs-guides on or our LIBD/JHU colleagues, as well as useful R functions/packages that we can write to help us and others. 6.2.1 Notes You don’t have to be a part of Leonardo’s team to be a DSgs-guide and thus join this meeting. 6.3 Team help While each team member has an individual weekly meeting, sometimes some problems can be solved with other/fresh eyes looking at them as well as new ideas. If you are having one such problem, this is a great venue to get help for it. This space and time can also be used for asking some quick questions as well as addressing any administration announcements. "],
["helping-others.html", "7 Helping others 7.1 Linear regression example 7.2 DSgs guides 7.3 Bioconductor Support: practice grounds", " 7 Helping others Part of our job is helping others understand what we are doing. In my experience, we can use three different communication languages and different combinations of them are useful by others, given that everyone is different. These languages are: written text/words drawings and graphs math equations 7.1 Linear regression example For example, if we have a linear regression \\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon \\] with \\[ \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2) \\] and we want to explain the meaning of the coefficient \\(\\beta_1\\) then we can explain it as: Text: \\(\\beta_1\\) is the average change in our outcome \\(Y\\) for a one unit increase in our explanatory variable \\(X\\) The language here is quite precise and it can be hard to understand the implications of every word. This is the typical starting point for many questions: what does this mean? Drawings: image source We have three data points (\\(x_1\\), \\(y_1\\)), (\\(x_2\\), \\(y_2\\)) and (\\(x_3\\), \\(y_3\\)) and we draw a line that shows the relationship between our \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) variables (each on its own axis). This line that we have drawn (shown in red) has two components that can be summarized by a small triangle (shown in green). The triangle has one vertex that touches the Y axis, this is the intercept, also known as \\(\\beta_0\\). Then it has a side of length 1 on the x-axis, and \\(\\beta_1\\) is length of the vertical side of the triangle that starts at \\(Y = \\beta_0\\) and ends at our diagonal line. That is, \\(\\beta_1\\) is the height of the green triangle when the length is equal to 1 on the x-axis. This visual representation can be useful for understanding the words we started off with. Math: First, notice that our linear model is \\(E[Y] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X\\), then we provide two values for \\(X\\): little \\(x\\) and little \\(x\\) plus one, and compute the difference between them. That leads to the following equations (show further below). It can be very useful here to explain how the math on that first equation translates to the written text we started off with. \\[ E [Y | X = x + 1] - E[Y | X = x] \\] \\[ = ( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x + 1) ) - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x ) \\] \\[ = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_1 - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1 x \\] \\[ = (\\beta_0 - \\beta_0) + (\\beta_1 x - \\beta_1 x) + \\beta_1 \\] \\[ = \\beta_1 \\] 7.2 DSgs guides As DSgs-guides for the Data Science guidance sessions (DSgs), our role involves: Explaining a concept creatively. For example, the person asking the question might have been confused by a lecture or the documentation of a function, and we have to explain those written words using a combination of: other words, drawings, and/or math. Google searching. We might be more familiar with some useful keywords that can lead us to a more precise answer, or given our experience we might be able to tease apart faster possible answers from say a help forum to identify the answer that best matches our scenario. Providing ideas. If some code is not working, we can provide ideas on how to troubleshoot that problem as well as identify potential key components of an error message. For a given analysis path, we can also provide options on what routes to take including potential useful graphs to create. Baseline platform. We can help others get used to our baseline platform of tools we use. Hence why we go through the bootcamps to have a common knowledgebase and set of courses, workshops and books that we refer others to. We can also be a bouncing board for others to discuss their ideas, and sometimes help with our feedback. 7.2.1 DSgs-guide training Accomplishing our role as DSgs-guides can be a bit scary since others will expect us to know the answers to many different questions. They might also be under intense pressure and might try to offload some of that pressure on to us. In other words, human interactions are complex. To deal with this, we have defined a set of Interaction rules to protect us. But we also need some training. First of all, remember that it’s OK to not know the answer. Simply communicate that you don’t know the answer instead of trying to hide it. You can then: search for an answer prior to your next DSgs session with the person asking the question bring that question up during our DSgs: feedback weekly session request that someone else take over the question 4 Remember that some questions are very challenging! After all, at LIBD we are trying to answer complicated biological questions that no one has an answer to. During my time as a Teaching Assistant at JHBSPH: Biostatistics, we had an activity called the Teaching Assistant Training Day, which I have adapted for our purpose. This involves: Being a DSgs-guide Skits and games Role playing Characteristics of teaching I recommend also reading the following papers: Irwin D. J. Bross (1974) The Role of the Statistician: Scientist or Shoe Clerk, The American Statistician, 28:4, 126-127, DOI: 10.1080/00031305.1974.10479092 Lurie, William. “THE IMPERTINENT QUESTIONER: THE SCIENTIST’S GUIDE TO THE STATISTICIAN’S MIND.” American Scientist, vol. 46, no. 1, 1958, pp. 57–61. JSTOR, jstor.org/stable/27827055. Finney, D.J. (1982), The questioning statistician. Statist. Med., 1: 5-13. doi: 10.1002/sim.4780010103 7.2.2 Common responses 7.2.3 Internal sessions log In order to make our job easier the next time we get a similar question, we have an internal sessions log where we record: the question we got asked the links we referred anyone to or that we used during the session example code we used This log also helps us refresh our memory so we can remember what are the links we’ve told someone else to use and see their trajectory. The sessions log also enables DSgs-guides to learn from each other. It’s best to fill out an entry on the sessions log immediately after a session. That way your memory is fresh. That’s why we recommend planning for 10 minutes after a session to fill out your entry in the log and to send a message with the links from the session to the person who requested it 5 7.2.4 Getting started If you just joined the DSgs-guides team, then we need you to setup your Calendly account and provide a brief description of who you are and what you are interested in helping others with. 7.2.4.1 Calendly Calendly is a service that allows others to sign up for meetings with you. The free service lets you connect it with a single calendar, say your LIBD calendar 6. With the free account you can then specify a type of event which you can use to create a 25 min data science guidance session event like mine: Calendly event description Meet with Leonardo for a 25 minute session where he’ll try his best to guide you in your data science project or related question. Please provide information in advance that might be useful for preparing for this session based on https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/data-science-guidance-sessions.html#help-us-help-you. Thank you! I customized my event with: duration: 25 min date range: over a period of rolling days; 6 business days availability increments: 15 min minimum scheduling notice: 24 hrs 7 event buffers: before (5 min), after (10 min) To control the number of sessions per week, I only opened my availability for 4 days of the week 8 and specified 1 for the “event max per day” advanced setting 9. Choose your settings wisely such that you can avoid as much as possible having to reschedule meetings for others, that is, be careful with the expectations you create in others. Once you are done, we’ll need your public Calendly event link to add it to the DSgs sign up page. 7.2.4.2 Description We need a short description of who you are and what type of questions you are interested in helping others with. Since you’ll be learning while you help others, you might want to specify areas that you are actively learning more about. Below is a small template, but you might simply want to check the DSgs sign up page. * [YOUR NAME](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME) ([BioC Support](https://support.bioconductor.org/u/YOUR_PROFILE_NUMBER/)) - Research interests: xx, yy, zz. - Technologies I use: aa, bb, cc. - Learning about: uu, ii, oo. 7.3 Bioconductor Support: practice grounds We use Bioconductor R packages basically every day for our work and the main venue for asking for help related to Bioconductor is the Bioconductor Support website as mentioned in a previous chapter. A great way to learn is by helping others. So, DSgs-guides should try to help one person per week on the Bioconductor Support website. By doing so, they’ll learn more about Bioconductor, practice helping others, and also learn what information helpers need. Then, the next time the guides ask questions themselves, they’ll know what information they need to provide in order to help others help them. 7.3.1 Steps to follow To keep track of who we have helped please fill add an entry to the following Google Sheet. 10 Briefly, you need to: find a question you are interested in answering decide whether to reply as a comment or answer remember to be friendly 11 The Bioconductor Support website uses a “tags” mechanism where each tag is actually the name of a package in lower case. So, when you are searching for questions to answer, you might want to start with the tag for a package that you are interested in learning more about or that you are interested in. You might also want to look at the latest questions and maybe start with those that have no answers. Some questions are quite common, like issues with installing Bioconductor packages, so in a way, that could be a low hanging fruit. Note that you can also edit your profile and add watched tags which you can check on the top menu under “following”. Once you have chosen an interesting question, you can either write an answer or a comment. Comments are useful when you need more information from the person asking the question. For example, you might need them to provide their R session information, which will help you figure out what version of R and Bioconductor they are using 12. Comments and answers support Markdown replies, which can be quite helpful for formatting your answer 13. Here’s a template you can start using. Hi xx, ~~ answer ~~ Best, YOUR-NAME PS I&#39;m actively [learning how to help others](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/helping-others.html#bioconductor-support-practice-grounds), so please be patient with me. Thanks! ## R session information `sessioninfo::session_info()` output Remember that questions can have multiple answers, so other Bioconductor Community members might contribute their solutions, which is a great way to learn. Also, we are doing this as volunteers really, so if a question gets complicated, it’s OK to notify the person who asked it that you don’t have the time to help them further. Then study their answer from our sessions log, so that way you learn too and increase your personal knowledgebase.↩︎ You might want to have a template email where you can just copy the same links and code from the session into it.↩︎ Though I use my LIBD and my Gmail calendars and thus need to pay for Calendly’s more advanced features.↩︎ You want to have enough time to check the question someone asked and come prepared to the DSgs session.↩︎ You can choose what hours of the day you make yourself available to others.↩︎ I’m not 100% sure that this works on the free account.↩︎ Hm…. I guess that BioC profiles might be enough and more automated.↩︎ Sometimes people are unkind on the web or voice their frustrations. It’s hard not to take it personal at times, but try to remain as friendly as possible. Also, you don’t owe them anything and you should feel free to ignore unfriendly folks.↩︎ Many times, the solution is to upgrade to the latest Bioc-release version.↩︎ There is a limit in length, which is why I sometimes use public gists on my replies. Gists are automatically embedded in answers. This is useful if you want to include a long output from your own sessioninfo::session_info().↩︎ "],

["career-growth.html", "9 Career growth 9.1 Career planning session", " 9 Career growth While I would love that the people I’ve trained continued collaborating with me such that I can depend on them, everyone has different personal goals in mind and directions they want to take. Part of my job is to help you grow in the direction that you are interested in. To do so effectively, I need to hear from you since it’s impossible for me to know your thoughts. How to be a modern scientist by Jeff Leek has a chapter on career planning, which is written with students and postdocs in mind as is an adaptation of Ben Langmead’s postdoc questionnaire. However, I still think that most of this chapter applies regardless of your current position. This book is cheap (and you can get it for free) and is part of the recommended material. 9.1 Career planning session If I’m asking you to have a career planning session with me, please do the following: read the career planning chapter by Jeff Leek create a Google document where you answer at least the following questions, then share it to me before the meeting If we have met in the past, then write your new answers at the top of the document, but leave the older ones there, to remind us both of the progression of your choices over time. What is the next step you want to take in your career? 14 What are the main requirements? 15 Example job/grad/med school ad links can be useful to identify common requirements or what you like about them. What is the time window you have in mind? Who are you? Who do you want to be? What do you want people to notice about you? What is the main resource for people to find information about you? 16 What do you want to learn? What are the main projects you want to complete or work on? What conferences / seminars / hackathons are you interested in attending? Knowing when they are and what they request for presenting and for scholarships is useful for planning. If you feel like other questions from Ben’s list are relevant to you, feel free to answer them too. Some examples are: acquiring more responsibilities at LIBD, a change in title at LIBD, applying for grad/med school, a postdoc, a faculty job, an industry job.↩︎ For some jobs and applications you need recommendation letters, for others you need papers, for others you need to pass some type of test, for others you need to give a talk, or there might be specific courses you have to take.↩︎ You might have a LinkedIn profile, a website, a CV, a blog, a (professional) Twitter account, a GitHub profile, etc.↩︎ "]
