["introduction.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction The purpose of this book is to serve as a guide for training new team members and colleagues on how we do R/Bioconductor-powered Team Data Science. As a team, we run Data Science guidance sessions where we help others navigate the world of data science. Through those sessions we identify concepts that we might need to explain better and this book is where we concentrate all our knowledge. Thus it is continuously modified and expanded. We often refer others to this specific chapters of this book, which in a way is a gloried collection of bookmarks with some of our own explanations. "],

This involves a significant time commitment (~ 6 hours per week) and you need to discuss this with your supervisor. These commitments are: helping others through DSgs sessions ~ 200 minutes per week 1 a weekly 30 minute meeting as explained in DSgs: feedback attending the LIBD rstats club (1 hour per week) time for self-learning and/or building common resources (~ 1 hour per week) Additionally, we might have some additional training sessions. Some potential advantages are: access to all our training material, explained in detail at DSgs-guides a common structure for helping others at LIBD/JHU recognition through our DSgs session reports We recommend four 25 minute sessions, each with 15 minutes of preparation and 10 minutes of post-meeting wrap up.↩︎ "],

["team-meetings.html", "5 Team meetings 5.1 Papers &amp; software 5.2 DSgs: feedback 5.3 Team help", " 5 Team meetings Every week we meet for about an hour 20 minutes. The team meeting has three sections: [30 min] Papers &amp; software: we discuss either a paper or some software. The discussion is lead by a team member and the presentation is made public while the discussion is kept private. [30 min] Data Science guidance sessions: we talk about our sessions and provide internal feedback. [20 min] Help requests: we give open the floor to discuss anything we need help on from the rest of the team. 5.1 Papers &amp; software Each week, we rotate team members randomly using jaffelab::lab_presenters() as shown on this Google Spreadsheet. That team member is in charge of: finding a paper or a software of interest notifying the group about it one week ahead on Slack preparing a few slides to explain the main concepts to us (plan for a 15 minute presentation) We record that portion of our meeting and make it publicly available through TODO. We then discuss privately our thoughts on the paper or software. 5.1.1 Notes If you are randomly assigned a date that does not work for you, please get in touch with other team members and find someone who can switch with you. Thank you! If you are interested in joining us, please check our code of conduct, and get in touch with Leonardo. 5.2 DSgs: feedback Every week, the DSgs-guides meet to discuss recent guidance sessions with the following objectives: identify common topics that can be addressed in other venues such as the LIBD rstats club, this book, blog posts, etc ensure consistency of our responses to similar questions identify and address issues with our DSgs interaction rules We might identify topics that we need to either train the DSgs-guides on or our LIBD/JHU colleagues, as well as useful R functions/packages that we can write to help us and others. 5.2.1 Notes You don’t have to be a part of Leonardo’s team to be a DSgs-guide and thus join this meeting. 5.3 Team help While each team member has an individual weekly meeting, sometimes some problems can be solved with other/fresh eyes looking at them as well as new ideas. If you are having one such problem, this is a great venue to get help for it. This space and time can also be used for asking some quick questions as well as addressing any administration announcements. "],

["career-growth.html", "8 Career growth 8.1 Career planning session", " 8 Career growth While I would love that the people I’ve trained continued collaborating with me such that I can depend on them, everyone has different personal goals in mind and directions they want to take. Part of my job is to help you grow in the direction that you are interested in. To do so effectively, I need to hear from you since it’s impossible for me to know your thoughts. How to be a modern scientist by Jeff Leek has a chapter on career planning, which is written with students and postdocs in mind as is an adaptation of Ben Langmead’s postdoc questionnaire. However, I still think that most of this chapter applies regardless of your current position. This book is cheap (and you can get it for free) and is part of the recommended material. 8.1 Career planning session If I’m asking you to have a career planning session with me, please do the following: read the career planning chapter by Jeff Leek create a Google document where you answer at least the following questions, then share it to me before the meeting If we have met in the past, then write your new answers at the top of the document, but leave the older ones there, to remind us both of the progression of your choices over time. What is the next step you want to take in your career? 2 What are the main requirements? 3 Example job/grad/med school ad links can be useful to identify common requirements or what you like about them. What is the time window you have in mind? Who are you? Who do you want to be? What do you want people to notice about you? What is the main resource for people to find information about you? 4 What do you want to learn? What are the main projects you want to complete or work on? What conferences / seminars / hackathons are you interested in attending? Knowing when they are and what they request for presenting and for scholarships is useful for planning. If you feel like other questions from Ben’s list are relevant to you, feel free to answer them too. Some examples are: acquiring more responsibilities at LIBD, a change in title at LIBD, applying for grad/med school, a postdoc, a faculty job, an industry job.↩︎ For some jobs and applications you need recommendation letters, for others you need papers, for others you need to pass some type of test, for others you need to give a talk, or there might be specific courses you have to take.↩︎ You might have a LinkedIn profile, a website, a CV, a blog, a (professional) Twitter account, a GitHub profile, etc.↩︎ "]
