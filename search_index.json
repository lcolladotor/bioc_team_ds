["introduction.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction The purpose of this book is to serve as a guide for training new team members and colleagues on how we do R/Bioconductor-powered Team Data Science. As a team, we run Data Science guidance sessions where we help others navigate the world of data science. Through those sessions we identify concepts that we might need to explain better and this book is where we concentrate all our knowledge. Thus it is continuously modified and expanded. We often refer others to this specific chapters of this book, which in a way is a gloried collection of bookmarks with some of our own explanations. "],

This involves a significant time commitment (~ 7 hours per week) and you need to discuss this with your supervisor. These commitments are: helping others through DSgs sessions ~ 200 minutes per week 1 a weekly 30 minute meeting as explained in DSgs: feedback attending the LIBD rstats club (1 hour per week) time for self-learning and/or building common resources (~ 1 hour per week) (recommended) practice and learn how to help others through the Bioconductor Support: practice grounds (~ 30 min per week) Additionally, we might have some additional training sessions. Some potential advantages are: access to all our training material, explained in detail at DSgs-guides a common structure for helping others at LIBD/JHU recognition through our DSgs session reports We recommend four 25 minute sessions, each with 15 minutes of preparation and 10 minutes of post-meeting wrap up.↩︎ "],

["team-meetings.html", "6 Team meetings 6.1 Papers &amp; software 6.2 DSgs: feedback 6.3 Team help", " 6 Team meetings Every week we meet for about an hour 20 minutes. The team meeting has three sections: [30 min] Papers &amp; software: we discuss either a paper or some software. The discussion is lead by a team member and the presentation is made public while the discussion is kept private. [30 min] Data Science guidance sessions: we talk about our sessions and provide internal feedback. [20 min] Help requests: we give open the floor to discuss anything we need help on from the rest of the team. 6.1 Papers &amp; software Each week, we rotate team members randomly using jaffelab::lab_presenters() as shown on this Google Spreadsheet. That team member is in charge of: finding a paper or a software of interest notifying the group about it one week ahead on Slack preparing a few slides to explain the main concepts to us (plan for a 15 minute presentation) We record that portion of our meeting and make it publicly available through TODO. We then discuss privately our thoughts on the paper or software. 6.1.1 Notes If you are randomly assigned a date that does not work for you, please get in touch with other team members and find someone who can switch with you. Thank you! If you are interested in joining us, please check our code of conduct, and get in touch with Leonardo. 6.2 DSgs: feedback Every week, the DSgs-guides meet to discuss recent guidance sessions with the following objectives: identify common topics that can be addressed in other venues such as the LIBD rstats club, this book, blog posts, etc ensure consistency of our responses to similar questions identify and address issues with our DSgs interaction rules We might identify topics that we need to either train the DSgs-guides on or our LIBD/JHU colleagues, as well as useful R functions/packages that we can write to help us and others. 6.2.1 Notes You don’t have to be a part of Leonardo’s team to be a DSgs-guide and thus join this meeting. 6.3 Team help While each team member has an individual weekly meeting, sometimes some problems can be solved with other/fresh eyes looking at them as well as new ideas. If you are having one such problem, this is a great venue to get help for it. This space and time can also be used for asking some quick questions as well as addressing any administration announcements. "],
["helping-others.html", "7 Helping others 7.1 Linear regression example 7.2 DSgs guides 7.3 Bioconductor Support: practice grounds", " 7 Helping others Part of our job is helping others understand what we are doing. In my experience, we can use three different communication languages and different combinations of them are useful by others, given that everyone is different. These languages are: written text/words drawings and graphs math equations 7.1 Linear regression example For example, if we have a linear regression \\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon \\] with \\[ \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2) \\] and we want to explain the meaning of the coefficient \\(\\beta_1\\) then we can explain it as: Text: \\(\\beta_1\\) is the average change in our outcome \\(Y\\) for a one unit increase in our explanatory variable \\(X\\) The language here is quite precise and it can be hard to understand the implications of every word. This is the typical starting point for many questions: what does this mean? Drawings: image source We have three data points (\\(x_1\\), \\(y_1\\)), (\\(x_2\\), \\(y_2\\)) and (\\(x_3\\), \\(y_3\\)) and we draw a line that shows the relationship between our \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) variables (each on its own axis). This line that we have drawn (shown in red) has two components that can be summarized by a small triangle (shown in green). The triangle has one vertex that touches the Y axis, this is the intercept, also known as \\(\\beta_0\\). Then it has a side of length 1 on the x-axis, and \\(\\beta_1\\) is length of the vertical side of the triangle that starts at \\(Y = \\beta_0\\) and ends at our diagonal line. That is, \\(\\beta_1\\) is the height of the green triangle when the length is equal to 1 on the x-axis. This visual representation can be useful for understanding the words we started off with. Math: First, notice that our linear model is \\(E[Y] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X\\), then we provide two values for \\(X\\): little \\(x\\) and little \\(x\\) plus one, and compute the difference between them. That leads to the following equations (show further below). It can be very useful here to explain how the math on that first equation translates to the written text we started off with. \\[ E [Y | X = x + 1] - E[Y | X = x] \\] \\[ = ( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x + 1) ) - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x ) \\] \\[ = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_1 - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1 x \\] \\[ = (\\beta_0 - \\beta_0) + (\\beta_1 x - \\beta_1 x) + \\beta_1 \\] \\[ = \\beta_1 \\] 7.2 DSgs guides As DSgs-guides for the Data Science guidance sessions (DSgs), our role involves: Explaining a concept creatively. For example, the person asking the question might have been confused by a lecture or the documentation of a function, and we have to explain those written words using a combination of: other words, drawings, and/or math. Google searching. We might be more familiar with some useful keywords that can lead us to a more precise answer, or given our experience we might be able to tease apart faster possible answers from say a help forum to identify the answer that best matches our scenario. Providing ideas. If some code is not working, we can provide ideas on how to troubleshoot that problem as well as identify potential key components of an error message. For a given analysis path, we can also provide options on what routes to take including potential useful graphs to create. Baseline platform. We can help others get used to our baseline platform of tools we use. Hence why we go through the bootcamps to have a common knowledgebase and set of courses, workshops and books that we refer others to. We can also be a bouncing board for others to discuss their ideas, and sometimes help with our feedback. 7.2.1 DSgs-guide training Accomplishing our role as DSgs-guides can be a bit scary since others will expect us to know the answers to many different questions. They might also be under intense pressure and might try to offload some of that pressure on to us. In other words, human interactions are complex. To deal with this, we have defined a set of Interaction rules to protect us. But we also need some training. First of all, remember that it’s OK to not know the answer. Simply communicate that you don’t know the answer instead of trying to hide it. You can then: search for an answer prior to your next DSgs session with the person asking the question bring that question up during our DSgs: feedback weekly session request that someone else take over the question 2 Remember that some questions are very challenging! After all, at LIBD we are trying to answer complicated biological questions that no one has an answer to. During my time as a Teaching Assistant at JHBSPH: Biostatistics, we had an activity called the Teaching Assistant Training Day, which I have adapted for our purpose. This involves: Being a DSgs-guide Skits and games Role playing Characteristics of teaching I recommend also reading the following papers: Irwin D. J. Bross (1974) The Role of the Statistician: Scientist or Shoe Clerk, The American Statistician, 28:4, 126-127, DOI: 10.1080/00031305.1974.10479092 Lurie, William. “THE IMPERTINENT QUESTIONER: THE SCIENTIST’S GUIDE TO THE STATISTICIAN’S MIND.” American Scientist, vol. 46, no. 1, 1958, pp. 57–61. JSTOR, jstor.org/stable/27827055. Finney, D.J. (1982), The questioning statistician. Statist. Med., 1: 5-13. doi: 10.1002/sim.4780010103 7.2.2 Common responses 7.2.3 Internal sessions log In order to make our job easier the next time we get a similar question, we have an internal sessions log where we record: the question we got asked the links we referred anyone to or that we used during the session example code we used This log also helps us refresh our memory so we can remember what are the links we’ve told someone else to use and see their trajectory. The sessions log also enables DSgs-guides to learn from each other. It’s best to fill out an entry on the sessions log immediately after a session. That way your memory is fresh. That’s why we recommend planning for 10 minutes after a session to fill out your entry in the log and to send a message with the links from the session to the person who requested it 3 7.3 Bioconductor Support: practice grounds We use Bioconductor R packages basically every day for our work and the main venue for asking for help related to Bioconductor is the Bioconductor Support website as mentioned in a previous chapter. A great to learn is by helping others. So, DSgs-guides should try to help one person per week on the Bioconductor Support website. By doing so, they’ll learn more about Bioconductor, practice helping others, and also learn what information the person helping needs. Then, the next time the guides ask questions themselves, they’ll know what information they need to provide in order to help others help them. Help someone per week / motivation 7.3.1 Steps to follow Then study their answer from our sessions log, so that way you learn too and increase your personal knowledgebase.↩︎ You might want to have a template email where you can just copy the same links and code from the session into it.↩︎ "],

["career-growth.html", "9 Career growth 9.1 Career planning session", " 9 Career growth While I would love that the people I’ve trained continued collaborating with me such that I can depend on them, everyone has different personal goals in mind and directions they want to take. Part of my job is to help you grow in the direction that you are interested in. To do so effectively, I need to hear from you since it’s impossible for me to know your thoughts. How to be a modern scientist by Jeff Leek has a chapter on career planning, which is written with students and postdocs in mind as is an adaptation of Ben Langmead’s postdoc questionnaire. However, I still think that most of this chapter applies regardless of your current position. This book is cheap (and you can get it for free) and is part of the recommended material. 9.1 Career planning session If I’m asking you to have a career planning session with me, please do the following: read the career planning chapter by Jeff Leek create a Google document where you answer at least the following questions, then share it to me before the meeting If we have met in the past, then write your new answers at the top of the document, but leave the older ones there, to remind us both of the progression of your choices over time. What is the next step you want to take in your career? 4 What are the main requirements? 5 Example job/grad/med school ad links can be useful to identify common requirements or what you like about them. What is the time window you have in mind? Who are you? Who do you want to be? What do you want people to notice about you? What is the main resource for people to find information about you? 6 What do you want to learn? What are the main projects you want to complete or work on? What conferences / seminars / hackathons are you interested in attending? Knowing when they are and what they request for presenting and for scholarships is useful for planning. If you feel like other questions from Ben’s list are relevant to you, feel free to answer them too. Some examples are: acquiring more responsibilities at LIBD, a change in title at LIBD, applying for grad/med school, a postdoc, a faculty job, an industry job.↩︎ For some jobs and applications you need recommendation letters, for others you need papers, for others you need to pass some type of test, for others you need to give a talk, or there might be specific courses you have to take.↩︎ You might have a LinkedIn profile, a website, a CV, a blog, a (professional) Twitter account, a GitHub profile, etc.↩︎ "]
