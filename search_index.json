["introduction.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction The purpose of this book is to serve as a guide for training new team members and colleagues on how we do R/Bioconductor-powered Team Data Science. As a team, we run Data Science guidance sessions where we help others navigate the world of data science. Through those sessions we identify concepts that we might need to explain better and this book is where we concentrate all our knowledge. Thus it is continuously modified and expanded. We often refer others to this specific chapters of this book, which in a way is a gloried collection of bookmarks with some of our own explanations. "],
["data-science-guidance-sessions.html", "2 Data Science guidance sessions 2.1 Interaction rules 2.2 Help us help you 2.3 Sign up 2.4 DSgs session reports 2.5 Become a DSgs guide", " 2 Data Science guidance sessions Data is abundant in many aspects of our research work thanks to high-throughput experimental assays. While some analyses will require a significant amount of time from people who primarily do that type of work, we know that many of us are interested in learning more about working with data. As such, as a team, the DSgs-guides will provide Data Science guidance sessions (DSgs). These are 25 minute sessions where we’ll try our best to help you, teach you, troubleshoot with you, and overall guide you as much as we can. DSgs sessions are particularly helpful if you want to work on a data problem or gain some data skills across a period of weeks or months. Working with data and programming languages can have a steep learning curve and it can feel daunting. As a team, we have trained ourselves to have a common baseline and can help you get familiarized with the concept of a project-oriented workflow. This involves tools such as RStudio, git/GitHub, how to organize your code, how to ask for help, and overall tools to make your work more reproducible. These ideas when put into practice are very helpful for finding why things are not working, as we all inevitably encounter errors in our code and the open source software we rely on. Sometimes we won’t know the answer either, but maybe we can help you construct more specific Google search terms. Check the following slides for some of the initial ideas behind these sessions. 2.1 Interaction rules In order for DSgs sessions to run smoothly, it’s important that we have clear expectations of what we’ll do. DSgs sessions are not consulting sessions. We will help you as much as we can during the session, but after it’s over, we won’t spend time writing new code for you. That is, we will not take requests for work you need help finishing regardless of how important it is. That’s why we recommend planning ahead and even having weekly DSgs sessions if you have a deadline in mind instead of approaching us for help the week the project is due. We are most helpful early in a project cycle than at the end. We understand that you might be stressed or under significant pressure, but please follow our code of conduct 1. Otherwise, we will forced to stop meeting with you. 2.2 Help us help you When you sign up for a session, you will fill a small form where you can provide some information about why you want to meet. We will spend up to 15 minutes preparing for a session, and in order to make better use of that time, it is important that you provide us enough information so we can do a better job helping you. 2.2.1 Framing a question Instead of saying “I need help”, it will be useful for us if you can be more specific. For example, “I need help with jaffelab::cleaningY()” or “I need help installing the Bioconductor package SummarizedExperiment on a Windows machine”. The first example lets us know that exact function you need help with, so we can revise the documentation before hand and come prepared to the meeting. The second example mentions a specific R package, where to find it (Bioconductor), and what operating system you are using. Here are some more example help requests: I want to learn how to use R, where should I start? I finished the CBDS lesson on using GitHub but I need help using git at JHPCE. I have some data that I generated and want to explore it. Which plots should I make? A collaborator suggested a specific linear regression model (~ age * brain region), can you explain to me how to interpret the results? Which R package should I use for performing a gene ontology enrichment analysis? I’m interesting in using software xx you wrote, can you help me understand how to do yy with it? I like the visualization you made for project xx, can you help me make a similar one with my data? I want to adapt code xx your team wrote in the past and use it in my project, can you help me get started? 2.2.2 Useful information As problems get more specific, we will require more information. If you are encountering an R error that you need help with, providing a small reproducible example will make the whole experience much smoother. The R package that is very useful for providing such examples is reprex. You can watch our LIBD rstats club video on reprex to get more familiarized with this package. To share code with us, Please create a gist which can be either public or private. In the gist include all the commands you ran and the output you got. Or provide the reprex code (preferred option). If you are already using GitHub for version controlling your code, then include the link to the script you are running. If you have a companion log file at JHPCE, please share the full path to the log file 2 Ideally include the R session information which you can generate using options(width = 120); sessioninfo::session_info(). This information will be particularly useful for solving issues with cutting edge R/Bioconductor/GitHub packages. 2.3 Sign up If you are interested in a 25 minute Data Science guidance session, please sign up through the Calendly links below with a session with one of our guides.

This involves a significant time commitment (~ 7 hours per week) and you need to discuss this with your supervisor. These commitments are: helping others through DSgs sessions ~ 200 minutes per week 3 a weekly 30 minute meeting as explained in DSgs: feedback attending the LIBD rstats club (1 hour per week) time for self-learning and/or building common resources (~ 1 hour per week) (recommended) practice and learn how to help others through the Bioconductor Support: practice grounds (~ 30 min per week) Additionally, we might have some additional training sessions. Some potential advantages are: access to all our training material, explained in detail at DSgs-guides a common structure for helping others at LIBD/JHU recognition through our DSgs session reports We will update the code of conduct once Bioconductor publishes their latest code of conduct in the Fall of 2020.↩︎ You might want to use the sgejogs package for helping you create such log files.↩︎ We recommend four 25 minute sessions, each with 15 minutes of preparation and 10 minutes of post-meeting wrap up.↩︎ "],

Just like git commit messages, channels are cheap. The idea is to make one channel per project. Currently, we are adding all team members to each channel even if they are not working on the specific project. Team members not involved in the project should feel free to mute the channel. However, by being a part of the channel, they can then see images and code that we are working on, which in some situations can be useful. For example, maybe we figured out how to make a new plotly interactive graph in one channel, then others who are curious can get access to that knowledge and incorporate it into their projects. If you need help use: libd_helpdesk: for asking general questions to all team members and LIBD collaborators For team logistics, our channel is: libd_team_lcollado: meeting reminders, papers we’ll discuss and other team logistics The remaining main Slack channels are: libd_alumni: for all LIBD past and current members libd_dsgs: for the DSgs-guides libd_genomics_martinowich: a shared channel with the Martinowich lab Slack workspace libd_lunchtrain: for random topics as well as organizing lunch outings 4 using the /lunchtrain Slack command 5 libd_pkgs: for software (mostly R packages) we are making that is not specific to a particular project libd_rstats_club: for the LIBD rstats club libd_wfg: for the LIBD Writing Fellowship Group (WFG) which is a type of writing accountability group or writing agraphia group (WAG) There are also a set of public channels that we use frequently: conferences containers: docker, singularity, etc diversity funding general genomics_journal_club: a student-run journal club genomics_seminar: Genomics at JHU seminars jhpce: JHPCE users, though also check the bithelp and bitsupport mailing lists jhu_papers: where we announce papers with JHU authors joint_group_meeting: a JHU bi-weekly meeting led by Steven Salzberg and JHU colleagues.

["rbioconductor-data-science-bootcamps.html", "4 R/Bioconductor Data Science bootcamps 4.1 LIBD bootcamps 4.2 Team bootcamps 4.3 Bootcamp source materials", " 4 R/Bioconductor Data Science bootcamps In order to have a common set of external references and R knowledge that we use for the Data Science guidance sessions as well as our work, we have a series of R and Bioconductor bootcamps. Most of the material these bootcamps are based on is freely available or can be purchased for a small fee 6. Thus, we can feel confident that our LIBD and JHU collaborators will be able to access the material, as well as anyone else in the world. 4.1 LIBD bootcamps We have organized accessible bootcamps that have biologists in mind. If you spend most of your time coding, check the Team bootcamps further below. For all of these bootcamps, you should have the latest R and RStudio Desktop installed. You will typically need a computer with at least 8 GB of RAM. Session Time Prerequisites Topic 1 2020-10-05 3-5 pm R + RStudio Differential expression analysis (LIBD-style) 2 2020-10-06 3-5 pm R + RStudio Differential expression analysis (LIBD-style) 3 2020-10-07 1-3 pm R + RStudio Differential expression analysis (LIBD-style) 4.2 Team bootcamps The team bootcamps are really for our team members and other more advanced R/programming members and collaborators. However, the material we cover is within reach of everyone as long as you practice using R/Bioconductor here and there. The concepts covered are of use to all of us who work with R, but we understand that you might not have as much time to learn these materials. If that’s the case, please feel free to sign up for our Data Science guidance sessions and we’ll help you learn these concepts at your own pace. The first iteration of these bootcamps were run on September 2020 with the following schedule. For all of them, you should have the latest R and RStudio versions installed in your computer and be familiar with the R programming language. For a more structured working environment, we might use JHPCE’s computational resources while running RStudio on our computers and running code through a Linux terminal 7. You will probably need to spend time self-learning and practicing some of the material beyond these videos. If you just started learning about R, then these bootcamps will be quite challenging. Session Time Prerequisites Topic 1 2020-09-21 3-5 pm NA How to be a modern scientist 2 2020-09-22 3-5 pm R + RStudio What they forgot to teach you about R 3 2020-09-23 1-3 pm R + RStudio What they forgot to teach you about R 4 2020-09-24 3-5 pm R + RStudio The Elements of Data Analytic Style + CBDS 5 2020-09-28 3-5 pm R + RStudio The Elements of Data Analytic Style + CBDS 6 2020-09-29 3-5 pm Be a part of the DSgs-guides team DSgs-guide training 7 2020-09-30 1-3 pm RStudio + R functions Building Tidy Tools 8 2020-10-01 3-5 pm RStudio + R functions Building Tidy Tools 4.3 Bootcamp source materials There are tons of resources that are useful for learning about R, Bioconductor, and data science in general. We have selected some of those resources because: we are familiar with them they are freely available or can be purchased for a small fee we have heard good things about them 4.3.1 Main materials There are more materials out there than those that we’ve had a chance to learn about, and with time, this list will change. Here is our latest list. Introductory level course Cloud Based Data Science by Jeff Leek, Aboozar Hadavand, Shannon Ellis, Leslie Myint, Sarah McClymont, Leah Jager, and others. Advanced book R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. Useful for learning about the tidyverse, which is supported by RStudio. workshop What they forgot to teach you about R 2020 version by Kara Woo, Jenny Bryan, and Jim Hester. workshop Building Tidy Tools 2020 version by Charlotte Wickham and Hadley Wickham. General book The Elements of Data Analytic Style by Jeff Leek. book How to be a modern scientist by Jeff Leek. Statistics book Data Analysis for the Life Sciences by Rafael A Irizarry and Michael I Love. book Modern Statistics for Modern Biology by Susan Holmes and Wolfgang Huber. Bioconductor book Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor by Aaron Lun, Robert Amezquita, Stephanie Hicks, and Raphael Gottardo. workshop WEHI scRNA-seq course (2020) by Peter Hickey based on the OSCA book. workflows Bioconductor Common Workflows. There’s over 25 of them from many authors. We also highly recommend keeping an eye open for any new work from: Alison Presmanes Hill. Just look at her awesome projects website! Desirée De Leon. Note that Desirée started as an intern working with Alison, so it’s no surprise that her projects website is excellent. Allison Horst and in particular her stats-illustrations which are widely used and are very helpful when teaching statistical and R concepts. 4.3.2 Courses Our colleagues at Hopkins have also created Coursera courses (MOOCs) which you might be interested in, though they might involve other fees. These are: Genomic Data Science Specialization by Steven Salzberg, Jeff Leek, James Taylor (1979-2020), Mihaela Pertea, Ben Langmead, Jacob Pritt, Liliana Florea, Kasper Daniel Hansen. Actually, LIBD is an “industry partner” for this specialization. Data Science Specialization by Jeff Leek, Roger D. Peng, and Brian Caffo. Data Science: Foundations using R Specialization by Jeff Leek, Roger D. Peng, and Brian Caffo. Executive Data Science Specialization by Jeff Leek, Roger D. Peng, and Brian Caffo. The Unix Workbench by Sean Kross, Jeff Leek, Roger D. Peng, and Brian Caffo. Rafael Irizarry and his lab have also generated free teaching materials. A former postdoc with Rafael, Michael I Love also has teaching materials. Between them they have courses on: Introduction to Data Science (at least 8 college-level courses) Data Analysis for the Life Sciences (at least 4 graduate level courses) Genomics Data Analysis (at least 3 graduate level courses) They have lots of YouTube links organized on their old harvardx website, whose layout is based on Kasper Daniel Hansen’s Bioconductor for Genomic Data Science course. A lot of the resources listed are available through Leanpub which is a publishing platform for books and courses. Authors get to set a recommended price, but also a minimum price that can be as low as $0, thus making their materials free to use.↩︎ Check our LIBD rstats club videos on how to configure your macOS or Windows computer to work with JHPCE.↩︎ "],
["how-to-be-a-modern-scientist.html", "5 How to be a modern scientist", " 5 How to be a modern scientist Jeff Leek wrote a book called How to be a modern scientist that is available through Leanpub. This book compiled and re-arranged advice and ideas Jeff generated in the prior years and shared through the Simply Statistics blog. While the book is written with academics in mind, particularly graduate students and postdocs, nearly all of the advice in this book applies to us as well. We actively participate in writing academic papers and software, and we work very closely with graduate students and postdocs. We might even advise some through our Data Science guidance sessions. Hence being familiar with this knowledge that Jeff curated and developed is important for us. In the book, Jeff explains why something is important and also provides specific advice on tools he liked to use (in 2016) for implementing these ideas. Most chapters can be read independently, with “paper writing” directly linked to “reading scientific papers”. After reading the introduction, choose whichever chapter appeals to you the most in the moment. For some of the chapters, we have more specific information on this book such as: reading scientific papers and scientific talks are something we practice weekly on the Team meetings career planning was the basis for Career growth The full list of chapters is: Introduction Paper writing Publishing Peer review Data sharing Scientific blogging Scientific code Social media in science Teaching in science Books Internal scientific communication Scientific talks Reading scientific papers Credit Career planning Your online identity About the author We do everything in this book, though to different degrees. This book is actually a key part of our internal scientific communication. I’ve also done several of the things Jeff advises not to do ;) and maybe that’s why they are listed there hehe. Hopefully I’ve learned over the years though. "],

["team-meetings.html", "10 Team meetings 10.1 Papers &amp; software 10.2 DSgs: feedback 10.3 Team help", " 10 Team meetings Every week we meet for about an hour 20 minutes. The team meeting has three sections: [30 min] Papers &amp; software: we discuss either a paper or some software. The discussion is lead by a team member and the presentation is made public while the discussion is kept private. [30 min] Data Science guidance sessions: we talk about our sessions and provide internal feedback. [20 min] Help requests: we give open the floor to discuss anything we need help on from the rest of the team. 10.1 Papers &amp; software Each week, we rotate team members randomly using jaffelab::lab_presenters() as shown on this Google Spreadsheet. That team member is in charge of: finding a paper or a software of interest notifying the group about it one week ahead on Slack preparing a few slides to explain the main concepts to us (plan for a 15 minute presentation) We record that portion of our meeting and make it publicly available through TODO. We then discuss privately our thoughts on the paper or software. 10.1.1 Notes If you are randomly assigned a date that does not work for you, please get in touch with other team members and find someone who can switch with you. Thank you! If you are interested in joining us, please check our code of conduct, and get in touch with Leonardo. 10.2 DSgs: feedback Every week, the DSgs-guides meet to discuss recent guidance sessions with the following objectives: identify common topics that can be addressed in other venues such as the LIBD rstats club, this book, blog posts, etc ensure consistency of our responses to similar questions identify and address issues with our DSgs interaction rules We might identify topics that we need to either train the DSgs-guides on or our LIBD/JHU colleagues, as well as useful R functions/packages that we can write to help us and others. 10.2.1 Notes You don’t have to be a part of Leonardo’s team to be a DSgs-guide and thus join this meeting. 10.3 Team help While each team member has an individual weekly meeting, sometimes some problems can be solved with other/fresh eyes looking at them as well as new ideas. If you are having one such problem, this is a great venue to get help for it. This space and time can also be used for asking some quick questions as well as addressing any administration announcements. "],
["helping-others.html", "11 Helping others 11.1 Linear regression example 11.2 DSgs guides 11.3 Bioconductor Support: practice grounds 11.4 RStudio Education", " 11 Helping others Part of our job is helping others understand what we are doing. In my experience, we can use three different communication languages and different combinations of them are useful by others, given that everyone is different. These languages are: written text/words drawings and graphs math equations 11.1 Linear regression example For example, if we have a linear regression \\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X + \\epsilon \\] with \\[ \\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2) \\] and we want to explain the meaning of the coefficient \\(\\beta_1\\) then we can explain it as: Text: \\(\\beta_1\\) is the average change in our outcome \\(Y\\) for a one unit increase in our explanatory variable \\(X\\) The language here is quite precise and it can be hard to understand the implications of every word. This is the typical starting point for many questions: what does this mean? Drawings: image source We have three data points (\\(x_1\\), \\(y_1\\)), (\\(x_2\\), \\(y_2\\)) and (\\(x_3\\), \\(y_3\\)) and we draw a line that shows the relationship between our \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) variables (each on its own axis). This line that we have drawn (shown in red) has two components that can be summarized by a small triangle (shown in green). The triangle has one vertex that touches the Y axis, this is the intercept, also known as \\(\\beta_0\\). Then it has a side of length 1 on the x-axis, and \\(\\beta_1\\) is length of the vertical side of the triangle that starts at \\(Y = \\beta_0\\) and ends at our diagonal line. That is, \\(\\beta_1\\) is the height of the green triangle when the length is equal to 1 on the x-axis. This visual representation can be useful for understanding the words we started off with. Math: First, notice that our linear model is \\(E[Y] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X\\), then we provide two values for \\(X\\): little \\(x\\) and little \\(x\\) plus one, and compute the difference between them. That leads to the following equations (show further below). It can be very useful here to explain how the math on that first equation translates to the written text we started off with. \\[ E [Y | X = x + 1] - E[Y | X = x] \\] \\[ = ( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x + 1) ) - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x ) \\] \\[ = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_1 - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1 x \\] \\[ = (\\beta_0 - \\beta_0) + (\\beta_1 x - \\beta_1 x) + \\beta_1 \\] \\[ = \\beta_1 \\] 11.2 DSgs guides As DSgs-guides for the Data Science guidance sessions (DSgs), our role involves: Explaining a concept creatively. For example, the person asking the question might have been confused by a lecture or the documentation of a function, and we have to explain those written words using a combination of: other words, drawings, and/or math 8 Google searching. We might be more familiar with some useful keywords that can lead us to a more precise answer, or given our experience we might be able to tease apart faster possible answers from say a help forum to identify the answer that best matches our scenario. Providing ideas. If some code is not working, we can provide ideas on how to troubleshoot that problem as well as identify potential key components of an error message. For a given analysis path, we can also provide options on what routes to take including potential useful graphs to create. Baseline platform. We can help others get used to our baseline platform of tools we use. Hence why we go through the bootcamps to have a common knowledgebase and set of courses, workshops and books that we refer others to. We can also be a bouncing board for others to discuss their ideas, and sometimes help with our feedback. 11.2.1 DSgs-guide training Accomplishing our role as DSgs-guides can be a bit scary since others will expect us to know the answers to many different questions. They might also be under intense pressure and might try to offload some of that pressure on to us. In other words, human interactions are complex. To deal with this, we have defined a set of Interaction rules to protect us. But we also need some training. First of all, remember that it’s OK to not know the answer. Simply communicate that you don’t know the answer instead of trying to hide it. You can then: search for an answer prior to your next DSgs session with the person asking the question bring that question up during our DSgs: feedback weekly session request that someone else take over the question 9 Remember that some questions are very challenging! After all, at LIBD we are trying to answer complicated biological questions that no one has an answer to. During my time as a Teaching Assistant at JHBSPH: Biostatistics, we had an activity called the Teaching Assistant Training Day, which I have adapted for our purpose. This involves: Being a DSgs-guide Classify characteristics I recommend also reading the following papers: Irwin D. J. Bross (1974) The Role of the Statistician: Scientist or Shoe Clerk, The American Statistician, 28:4, 126-127, DOI: 10.1080/00031305.1974.10479092 Lurie, William. “THE IMPERTINENT QUESTIONER: THE SCIENTIST’S GUIDE TO THE STATISTICIAN’S MIND.” American Scientist, vol. 46, no. 1, 1958, pp. 57–61. JSTOR, jstor.org/stable/27827055. Finney, D.J. (1982), The questioning statistician. Statist. Med., 1: 5-13. doi: 10.1002/sim.4780010103 11.2.2 Common responses 11.2.3 Internal sessions log In order to make our job easier the next time we get a similar question, we have an internal sessions log where we record: the question we got asked the links we referred anyone to or that we used during the session example code we used This log also helps us refresh our memory so we can remember what are the links we’ve told someone else to use and see their trajectory. The sessions log also enables DSgs-guides to learn from each other. The internal sessions log is then used to populate the content of the DSgs_logs website. It’s best to fill out an entry on the sessions log immediately after a session. That way your memory is fresh. That’s why we recommend planning for 10 minutes after a session to fill out your entry in the log and to send a message with the links from the session to the person who requested it 10 11.2.4 Getting started If you just joined the DSgs-guides team, then we need you to setup your Calendly account and provide a brief description of who you are and what you are interested in helping others with. 11.2.4.1 Calendly Calendly is a service that allows others to sign up for meetings with you. The free service lets you connect it with a single calendar, say your LIBD calendar 11. With the free account you can then specify a type of event which you can use to create a 25 min data science guidance session event like mine: Calendly event description Meet with Leonardo for a 25 minute session where he’ll try his best to guide you in your data science project or related question. Please provide information in advance that might be useful for preparing for this session based on https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/data-science-guidance-sessions.html#help-us-help-you. Thank you! I customized my event with: duration: 25 min date range: over a period of rolling days; 6 business days availability increments: 15 min minimum scheduling notice: 24 hrs 12 event buffers: before (5 min), after (10 min) To control the number of sessions per week, I only opened my availability for 4 days of the week 13 and specified 1 for the “event max per day” advanced setting 14. Choose your settings wisely such that you can avoid as much as possible having to reschedule meetings for others, that is, be careful with the expectations you create in others. Once you are done, we’ll need your public Calendly event link to add it to the DSgs sign up page. 11.2.4.2 Description We need a short description of who you are and what type of questions you are interested in helping others with. Since you’ll be learning while you help others, you might want to specify areas that you are actively learning more about. Below is a small template, but you might simply want to check the DSgs sign up page. * [YOUR NAME](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME) ([BioC Support](https://support.bioconductor.org/u/YOUR_PROFILE_NUMBER/)) - Research interests: xx, yy, zz. - Technologies I use: aa, bb, cc. - Learning about: uu, ii, oo. - [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) 11.3 Bioconductor Support: practice grounds We use Bioconductor R packages basically every day for our work and the main venue for asking for help related to Bioconductor is the Bioconductor Support website as mentioned in a previous chapter. A great way to learn is by helping others. So, DSgs-guides should try to help one person per week on the Bioconductor Support website. By doing so, they’ll learn more about Bioconductor, practice helping others, and also learn what information helpers need. Then, the next time the guides ask questions themselves, they’ll know what information they need to provide in order to help others help them. 11.3.1 Steps to follow To keep track of who we have helped please fill add an entry to the following Google Sheet. 15 Briefly, you need to: find a question you are interested in answering decide whether to reply as a comment or answer remember to be friendly 16 The Bioconductor Support website uses a “tags” mechanism where each tag is actually the name of a package in lower case. So, when you are searching for questions to answer, you might want to start with the tag for a package that you are interested in learning more about or that you are interested in. You might also want to look at the latest questions and maybe start with those that have no answers. Some questions are quite common, like issues with installing Bioconductor packages, so in a way, that could be a low hanging fruit. Note that you can also edit your profile and add watched tags which you can check on the top menu under “following”. Once you have chosen an interesting question, you can either write an answer or a comment. Comments are useful when you need more information from the person asking the question. For example, you might need them to provide their R session information, which will help you figure out what version of R and Bioconductor they are using 17. Comments and answers support Markdown replies, which can be quite helpful for formatting your answer 18. Here’s a template you can start using. Hi xx, ~~ answer ~~ Best, YOUR-NAME PS I&#39;m actively [learning how to help others](https://lcolladotor.github.io/bioc_team_ds/helping-others.html#bioconductor-support-practice-grounds), so please be patient with me. Thanks! ## R session information `sessioninfo::session_info()` output Remember that questions can have multiple answers, so other Bioconductor Community members might contribute their solutions, which is a great way to learn. Also, we are doing this as volunteers really, so if a question gets complicated, it’s OK to notify the person who asked it that you don’t have the time to help them further. 11.4 RStudio Education If you want to go even further, you might be interested in the RStudio Education: learn to teach website. Use the Remember to use the main materials, such as the illustrations by Allison Horst, to avoid having to reinvent the wheel and for quick access to great illustrations. ↩︎ Then study their answer from our sessions log, so that way you learn too and increase your personal knowledgebase.↩︎ You might want to have a template email where you can just copy the same links and code from the session into it.↩︎ Though I use my LIBD and my Gmail calendars and thus need to pay for Calendly’s more advanced features.↩︎ You want to have enough time to check the question someone asked and come prepared to the DSgs session.↩︎ You can choose what hours of the day you make yourself available to others.↩︎ I’m not 100% sure that this works on the free account.↩︎ Hm…. I guess that BioC profiles might be enough and more automated.↩︎ Sometimes people are unkind on the web or voice their frustrations. It’s hard not to take it personal at times, but try to remain as friendly as possible. Also, you don’t owe them anything and you should feel free to ignore unfriendly folks.↩︎ Many times, the solution is to upgrade to the latest Bioc-release version.↩︎ There is a limit in length, which is why I sometimes use public gists on my replies. Gists are automatically embedded in answers. This is useful if you want to include a long output from your own sessioninfo::session_info().↩︎ "],

["career-growth.html", "13 Career growth 13.1 Career planning session", " 13 Career growth While I would love that the people I’ve trained continued collaborating with me such that I can depend on them, everyone has different personal goals in mind and directions they want to take. Part of my job is to help you grow in the direction that you are interested in. To do so effectively, I need to hear from you since it’s impossible for me to know your thoughts. How to be a modern scientist by Jeff Leek has a chapter on career planning, which is written with students and postdocs in mind as is an adaptation of Ben Langmead’s postdoc questionnaire. However, I still think that most of this chapter applies regardless of your current position. This book is cheap (and you can get it for free) and is part of the recommended material. 13.1 Career planning session If I’m asking you to have a career planning session with me, please do the following: read the career planning chapter by Jeff Leek create a Google document where you answer at least the following questions, then share it to me before the meeting If we have met in the past, then write your new answers at the top of the document, but leave the older ones there, to remind us both of the progression of your choices over time. What is the next step you want to take in your career? 19 What are the main requirements? 20 Example job/grad/med school ad links can be useful to identify common requirements or what you like about them. What is the time window you have in mind? Who are you? Who do you want to be? What do you want people to notice about you? What is the main resource for people to find information about you? 21 What do you want to learn? What are the main projects you want to complete or work on? What conferences / seminars / hackathons are you interested in attending? Knowing when they are and what they request for presenting and for scholarships is useful for planning. If you feel like other questions from Ben’s list are relevant to you, feel free to answer them too. Some examples are: acquiring more responsibilities at LIBD, a change in title at LIBD, applying for grad/med school, a postdoc, a faculty job, an industry job.↩︎ For some jobs and applications you need recommendation letters, for others you need papers, for others you need to pass some type of test, for others you need to give a talk, or there might be specific courses you have to take.↩︎ You might have a LinkedIn profile, a website, a CV, a blog, a (professional) Twitter account, a GitHub profile, etc.↩︎ "]
